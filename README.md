# Alecont√≠n's Random Assortment Of Items
This is a [The Binding Of Isaac: Repentance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/) mod made using the [REPENTOGON](https://github.com/TeamREPENTOGON/REPENTOGON) LUA script extension that adds items I thought would be cool to make.

You can download the mod from this github page by [clicking here](https://github.com/Alecontin/ARAOI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), or by subscribing to it in the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3265264784).

Everything this mod adds has [External Item Descriptions](https://github.com/wofsauge/External-Item-Descriptions) support.



If you feel like an item is unbalanced, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Alecontin/ARAOI/issues) or modify the items yourself.
